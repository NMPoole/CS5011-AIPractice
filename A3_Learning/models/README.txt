Models used for analysis. All of the models seeded with
`12345' are provided for each of the implemented tasks.
Note again that when specifying these models to the
program, only include the prefix before "-TrainedModel.bin".
For example, to use "task1_NN_12345-TrainedModel.bin", use
"task1_NN_12345" as the <input_nn_name> program argument.
