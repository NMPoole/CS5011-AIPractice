# CS5011 AI Practice

This repository demonstrates work completed as part of the **CS5011 AI Practice** module.
Specifically, four different AI practice domaisn were considered: search, logic, learning, and uncertainty.

# Search:

Several pathfinding/search algorithms have been implemented to find solutions for a _Coastguard Rescue Simulation_. 
In this simulation, a robot is required to search for a path from a person who requires rescuing to a position of safety amongst the [Giantâ€™s Causeway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giant%27s_Causeway).

Uninformed (depth-first and breadth-first) and informed (best-first and A*) search algorithms have been implemented to find solutions to various configurations of this problem. 
Additionally, the bidirectional search (BDS) algorithm has been implemented for comparison. 
An alternate/extension heuristic has also been implemented for heuristic comparisons with the informed search algorithms.
In all cases, experiments have been performed to evaluate and compare these search algorithms.

# Logic:

Logical (procedural and declarative) techniques have been used to implement a solver and hint system for the [Easy As ABC](http://puzzlepicnic.com/genre?id=8) puzzle using constraint programming. A rudimentary hint system for this puzzle has also been developed, which follows a similar chain of logic a person would usually follow when completing the puzzle. A brief evaluation comparing the procedural and declarative techniques is performed, as well as a critical discussion of the developed hint system.
