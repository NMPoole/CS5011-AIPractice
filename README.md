# CS5011 AI Practice

This repository demonstrates work completed as part of the **CS5011 AI Practice** module.
Specifically, four different AI practice domaisn were considered: search, logic, learning, and uncertainty.

1. **Search:** Several pathfinding/search algorithms have been implemented to find solutions for a _Coastguard Rescue Simulation_. 
In this simulation, a robot is required to search for a path from a person who requires rescuing to a position of safety amongst the [Giantâ€™s Causeway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giant%27s_Causeway).
Uninformed (depth-first and breadth-first) and informed (best-first and A*) search algorithms have been implemented to find solutions to various configurations of this problem. 
Additionally, the bidirectional search (BDS) algorithm has been implemented for comparison. 
An alternate/extension heuristic has also been implemented for heuristic comparisons with the informed search algorithms.
In all cases, experiments have been performed to evaluate and compare these search algorithms.

2. **Logic:** 

3. **Learning:** 

4. **Uncertainty:**
